+ Throughout **Luke**, Jesus shows us **kingdom of God**

Behold, I am **coming soon**, bringing my **recompense** with me,<br>
to repay each one for what he has **done**.

I am the **Alpha** and the **Omega**, <br>
the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

[Revelation 22:12-13 (ESV)](# "ref")

+ He is the One who **started** history, and He will **wrap** it up
+ He is not some cosmic **Santa Claus** handing out **presents**
+ He has ultimate **authority** to kill and give **life**
  + It is **just** bc He **defines** what justice is
+ He is returning to **settle accounts**
  + Like it or not, He is **King** -- will I **yield** to Him?
+ Sometimes I don't **want** to submit,
  + don't want to **speak** His Word
  + feel **weight** of worry of getting it **wrong**, rather not even **try**
+ But **woe** to me if I do not preach the **gospel** (1Cor9)
  + At the **minimum**, I have a **stewardship** to fulfill
+ Remember Christ is coming, bringing His **recompense**:

# Am I **unwilling** <br> for Christ <br> to **rule** over me?

>>>
+ If so, it's not too **late** to change
+ Make Him **King** over my heart and every facet of my **life**
+ Receive His free **gift** of forgiveness in humility and faith
+ Change my **thinking**, priorities, speech, actions, habits
  + to **align** with God's priorities
+ Use the **blessings** He entrusted to me to show
  + **compassion** to others, **defend** poor, **care** for needy
+ He **wants** to see what we'll **do** with His investment!
+ When the **Son of Man** comes, will He find **faith** on the earth?

+ Thank You, Lord, for your abundant **blessings**
  + which show what a **good** Father You are
+ Thank You for the **opportunity** to demonstrate **faithfulness**
  + with all that You've **entrusted** to us
+ Our actions reveal our hearts' **attitudes** toward You:
+ Whether we see You as a **kind** master, **working** within us
  + and desiring to share your **joy** with us,
+ Or as an **austere** and unreasonable **taskmaster**.
+ Our actions reveal our **own** character:
  + Whether we are **diligent**, faithful, looking to **reward** w/You
  + Or **fearful**, bitter, **rebellious** against Your authority
+ **Turn** our hearts back to You, to be **good** + **faithful** servants
