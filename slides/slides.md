Because you have been faithful in a **very little**, <br>

Luke: kingdom of God (is not what you think it is)
ch18-19: Jesus' final journey to Jerusalem, triumphal entry

18:8 God certainly hears the cry of the oppressed: but when He comes, will He find faith?
18:17 kingdom of God belongs to those who **humble** themselves like a child: e.g.,
18:13 tax collector's prayer
18:39 blind beggar who cried out all the more
19:10 Zacchaeus: the lost whom Christ seeks+saves

Mt24:4-14 end of the age: wars, famine, false prophets, persecution
caught unawares:
24:37 as in the days of Noah
24:50 as wicked steward
25:8 as unprepared wedding guests

[find photo of mina coin]
mina = 100 days' wages: ~$15-20k
cf Mt25 talent = 60 minas
so not a ton of money: purpose is to demonstrate **faithfulness** w/investment

1. good servants
faithful in littlest
reward is 10 **cities**: the mina pales in comparison
look what your mina has produced: God enables, but we invest it, to the glory of God

appl: money/job: integrity, pursuing justice
appl: providing for those in our care: Mt24:45-46 gives food at proper time
appl: cultivating mercy: Mt25:37-40 hunger, stranger, naked, sick, prison

2. wicked servant
look, here's your mina (not what it has produced)
all of them **return** mina to master
1st servant keeps 10 minas earned
not how much God has blessed us with, but what we do with it

3. enemies
seems harsh?
Christ will return as conquering king
