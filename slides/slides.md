The **first** came before him, saying, <br>
‘Lord, your mina has made **ten minas** more.’ 

And he said to him, ‘**Well done**, good servant! <br>
Because you have been faithful in a **very little**, <br>
you shall have authority over **ten cities**.’

faithful in littlest
reward is 10 **cities**: the mina pales in comparison
look what your mina has produced: God enables, but we invest it, to the glory of God
saved by faith: but faith lived out in obedience

we think of little things as:
  spend 10min playing w/little kid
  buy sandwich for street person
but the littlest here is money!
  yes, be financially responsible, good steward
  but that's the basic minimum
even more important:
  showing compassion, providing for others

appl: money/job: integrity, pursuing justice
appl: providing for those in our care: Mt24:45-46 gives food at proper time
appl: cultivating mercy: Mt25:37-40 hunger, stranger, naked, sick, prison

And he said to those who stood by, <br>

1st servant keeps 10 minas earned
not how much God has blessed us with, but what we do with it
austere: unreasonable in demands
but master is not: not asking for something from nothing, but invested initial mina
  would have been ok with basic interest
risk-averse: afraid would lose mina due to forces beyond his control
  but master not concerned about money (only 1 mina), 
  wanted to see what servant would do with it
