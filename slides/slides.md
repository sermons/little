ch18-19: Jesus' final journey to Jerusalem, triumphal entry

18:8 God certainly hears the cry of the oppressed: but when He comes, will He find faith?
18:17 kingdom of God belongs to those who **humble** themselves like a child: e.g.,
18:13 tax collector's prayer
18:39 blind beggar who cried out all the more
19:10 Zacchaeus: the lost whom Christ seeks+saves

Mt24:4-14 end of the age: wars, famine, false prophets, persecution
caught unawares:
24:37 as in the days of Noah
24:50 as wicked steward
25:8 as unprepared wedding guests

[find photo of mina coin]
mina = 100 days' wages: ~$15-20k
cf Mt25 talent = 60 minas
so not a ton of money: purpose is to demonstrate **faithfulness** w/investment

1. good servants
faithful in littlest
reward is 10 **cities**: the mina pales in comparison
look what your mina has produced: God enables, but we invest it, to the glory of God
saved by faith: but faith lived out in obedience

appl: money/job: integrity, pursuing justice
appl: providing for those in our care: Mt24:45-46 gives food at proper time
appl: cultivating mercy: Mt25:37-40 hunger, stranger, naked, sick, prison

Q: in what do I need to be more faithful?

2. wicked servant
look, here's your mina (not what it has produced)
all of them **return** mina to master
1st servant keeps 10 minas earned
not how much God has blessed us with, but what we do with it
austere: unreasonable in demands
but master is not: not asking for something from nothing, but invested initial mina
  would have been ok with basic interest
risk-averse: afraid would lose mina due to forces beyond his control
  but master not concerned about money (only 1 mina), 
  wanted to see what servant would do with it

Q: have I felt God to be austere or unreasonable?

3. enemies
seems harsh?
Christ will return as conquering king

Q: am I unwilling for God to rule over me?
