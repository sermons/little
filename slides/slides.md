# Faithful in <br> the Littlest
## Luke 19:11-27

>>>
+ When we are **overwhelmed** by trouble, 
  + **despairing** at the state of the world, 
  + **indignant** that things are not right
+ We **expect** that God will **rescue** us
  + look **forward** to coming of **kingdom** of God
  + when He'll come and just **fix** things
+ But is it **possible** that I've:

<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# Have I **misunderstood** <br> the coming of the **kingdom** of God?

>>>
+ Think Jesus'll return to **pay back** all who've **wronged** me
  + to **judge** those who haven't fulfilled their **responsib** to me
+ But what about **myself**? Have I **wronged** others 
  + or **neglected** my responsibilities before God?
+ Throughout **Luke**, Jesus shows us **kingdom of God** 
  + It's **not** what you think it is!
+ Behold the **Lamb** of God:
+ **[ PRAYER ]**
+ Give us **ears** to hear, **eyes** to see, **hearts** to understand
  + what the **coming** of Your **kingdom** will bring
+ May we **turn** our hearts + actions, turn in **obedience** to You,
  + turn before it's too **late**, may we turn and be **healed**

+ Travelling through **Jericho** on final journey to **Jerusalem**,
  + leading up to **cross**
+ **Kingdom** of God belongs to those who 
  + **humble** themselves like a child: e.g.,
+ **Tax collector** who only prayed:
  + "God have **mercy** on me, a sinner!"
+ Blind **beggar** who cried out all the more
+ **Zacchaeus**: one of the lost whom Christ seeks + saves
+ First segment in ch18, on **persistent widow**, illustrates
  + the **comfort** + **challenge** Jesus presents us:

And will not God bring about <br/>
**justice** for his **chosen ones**,

who cry out to him day and night? <br/>
Will he keep **putting them off**?

[Luke 18:7 (NIV) (p.1/2)](# "ref")

---
<!-- .slide: <%= bg("unsplash-ywtbSuCSjhM-sunbeam-valley.jpg") %> -->
I tell you, he will see that <br/>
they get **justice**, and **quickly**.

However, when the **Son of Man** comes, <br/>
will he find **faith** on the earth?

[Luke 18:8 (NIV) (p.2/2)](# "ref")

>>>
+ God certainly **hears** the cry of the **oppressed**:
  + So we put our **hope** in His **rescue**
+ But when He **comes**, will He find **faith**?
+ Not simply that we **waited** for His rescue
  + But **active** waiting: active **faith**
+ Faithfully **investing** the blessings He's lent us
  + in expectation of an infinitely **greater** reward in heaven

1. The Wicked Servant [(v20-26)](# "ref")
1. The Enemies of the King [(v14,27)](# "ref")

>>>
+ 1: What the Master is **looking** for from us
+ 2: How he **failed**
+ 3: **authority** of the King
  + **importance** of a submissive heart toward Him
+ Key to **understanding** this parable is in v11:
  + the **reason** Jesus tells this parable is

---
because he was near to **Jerusalem**, <br>
and because they supposed that <br>
the **kingdom of God** was to appear **immediately**. 

[Luke 19:11 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Living under corrupt **oppression**:
  + felt that God had **forgotten** them
  + hoping kingdom of God would mean their **deliverance**
+ Jesus: that's **not** what coming of Kingdom will be like!
+ **1st** coming was to **redeem** His own (buy back)
  + **2nd** coming is to **judge** the nations
+ 1st coming Jesus rode a **donkey**: humble, suffering Servant
  + 2nd, at final **judgment**:

---
Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a **white horse**! <br>
The one sitting on it is called **Faithful** and **True**, <br>
and in righteousness he **judges** and makes **war**.

+ **Warning**: amidst wars, famine, persecu., false prophets
  + which will accompany the **end** of the age,
+ We must not be caught **unprepared** for Christ's return,
  + as they were in the days of **Noah**
  + as lazy **manager** not expecting his master's return
  + as unprepared **wedding guests** w/o foresight or perseverance
+ Today's passage is more than just your **dad's** admonition,
  + "Don't **waste** time!  Don't waste **money**!"
+ It's about being **prepared** for **coming** of kingdom of God.

Calling **ten** of his servants, <br>
he gave them ten **minas** <br>

+ mina = 100 days' wages: ~$15-20k
  + cf Mt25 talent = 60 minas; 5/2/1 talents
+ So not ton of money: focus not on **amount** of money earned
  + Would've been **clear** to all parties it was a **test**
+ Purpose is to demonstrate **faithfulness** w/investment
+ Master's **instruction**:

  + Deliberate **process**, trained **habits**
  + which put **planning** into **action**
+ Other words for **work** accomplished (focusing on **result**)

+ Master wants to see the **decisions** they'd make
  + not simply the **end result**

The **first** came before him, saying, <br>
‘Lord, your mina has made **ten minas** more.’

+ 1000% ROI (though time horizon not specified)
+ "Look what **your** mina has produced":
  + not: "look at what **I've** produced"
+ But the servant had to make **decisions** and be **diligent**
  + God **enables**, but we **invest** it, to the **glory** of God
+ Certainly, God's investments are not merely **monetary**, but
  + He showers abundant **blessings** in every area of life
+ And the master's **response**?

---
And he said to him, ‘**Well done**, good servant! <br>
Because you have been faithful in a **very little**, <br>
you shall have authority over **ten cities**.’ 

[Luke 19:17 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Master considers that mina (even 10 minas) the **littlest**
  + (superlative) **least**, smallest, most insignificant
+ The **reward** is 10 **cities**! incomparably **greater**
+ **Matt** adds: "enter into the **joy** of your master"
  + To **share** in the **joy** of our King 
  + is the **greatest** reward (far better than ice cream!)
+ Now, if **top student** in class has gone ahead of you,
  + you might empathise with the **second** servant:

---
And the **second** came, saying, <br>
‘Lord, your mina has made **five minas**.’ 

And he said to him, <br>
‘And you are to be over **five cities**.’ 

[Luke 19:18-19 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ aw, only **500%** ROI! Master didn't even say, "**Well done!**"
+ But **comparing** with the first servant is **pointless**:
  + He still got **5 cities**!  
+ The **immensity** of the reward far outweighs any competition
+ Bc the **greatest** reward is the **joy** of the master
+ It was never **about** the money:
  + the master was looking for **faithfulness**

---
>>>
+ When we think of "being faithful in the **little things**":
  + spend 10min **playing** w/little kid
  + buy **sandwich** for street person
  + not **laughing** along with a cruel joke
+ But the **littlest thing** here refers to **money**!
  + yes, be financially **responsible**, good steward of resources
  + but that's the basic **minimum** of faithfulness
+ Even **more** important responsibility:
  + show **compassion**, **provide** for others
+ After the parable in **Matt 25**, Jesus describes 
  + His **sheep** who will **inherit** the kingdom:

---
"Lord, when did we see you **hungry** and feed you, <br>
or **thirsty** and give you drink? <br>
And when did we see you a **stranger** and welcome you, <br>
or **naked** and clothe you? <br>
And when did we see you **sick** or in **prison** and visit you?" 

And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, <br>
as you did it to one of the **least** of these my **brothers**, <br>
you did it to **me**.’

[Matthew 25:37-40 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ In our **schooling** / careers: w/**classmates**, coworkers, clients:
  + do we pursue **integrity** + justice in our dealings?
+ With those **people** God has entrusted into our **care**:
  + **children**, elderly, infirm
  + do we **serve** with patience and **gentleness** in God's grace?
+ With the **needy** in our city
  + the immigrants / **refugees**, incarcerated:
  + do we cultivate **mercy** + compassion as God showed to us?
+ This is our **coin**, our mina: it **is** our responsibility before God!

  + what does that reveal about **our** misconceptions of God?

  + This one: "See, your **mina**, returned to you!"
+ Carefully **protected**, not stolen, lost, or **squandered**
  + Put the **importance** on the **coin** itself
+ Master probably said, 
  + "**yeah** ok, thx, I have a whole **box** of them"
+ Servant feels a need to **justify** himself:

---
for I was **afraid** of you, <br>
because you are a **severe** man. <br>
You **take** what you did not deposit, <br>
and **reap** what you did not sow.’ 

[Luke 19:21 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Try that **tactic** next time **afraid** boss/teacher will reprimand:
  + Preemptory **insult**! It's **your** fault
+ "Severe": **austere**, harsh as dry wind, abrasive, unyielding
  + Expecting **sth** from **nothing**, **unreasonable** in demands
+ Servant was **afraid** that if he **invested**,
  + he might **lose** money, and the master would go **ballistic**
+ So he'd rather not **touch** the coin at all
+ e.g., father buys me **house**: but I'm reminded it was **his** money
  + so I only use a small **corner** of it, don't **touch** rooms
  + nor **maintain** house, **mow** lawn: **nervous** he'll be **mad**
+ But what would a **loving** father say?

---
He said to him, ‘I will **condemn** you <br>
with your own words, you **wicked** servant! 

You knew that I was a **severe** man, <br>
**taking** what I did not deposit and <br>
**reaping** what I did not sow? 

[Luke 19:22 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ In fact, the master was **not** an austere or unreasonable man:
+ He **provided** initial investment for each servant
  + Not asking for something from **nothing**
+ Would have been ok with even the bare **minimum** investment:

---
Why then did you not put my money in the **bank**, <br>
and at my coming I might have 
collected it with **interest**?’ 

[Luke 19:23 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "Interest": what **grows** of itself: no work required, zero **risk**
  + Storing coin in cloth actually **lost** value due to inflation
+ If had **invested**, even if **lost** money due to external forces,
  + master probably would have still been **ok** with him
+ Bc point was not about the **coin** but **decision-making**
  + (so maybe if poor **decisions**, wouldn't get any **cities**!)
+ And those **minas**, the initial investment,
  + all went **back** to the master:

---
And he said to those who stood by, <br>
‘**Take** the mina from him, and <br>
give it to the one who has the **ten** minas.’ 

And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’

+ Notice that 1st servant had **10**, not 11:

+ He got to keep what he **earned**,

+ Whatever God **blesses** us with, we have to **return**

+ **Paradox** of righteousness:

[Luke 19:27 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Seems **harsh**?
+ Christ will return as **conquering** King
+ The revealing of the **kingdom** of God is not fundamentally

Behold, I am **coming soon**, bringing my **recompense** with me,<br>
